ZKM has 4 different jars, every plugin can work with different zkm file
change plugin name to input.jar
put to this folder
and try zkm files
check strings text file
if strings deobfuscated then you can check output.jar
Only input.jar put to ZKM folder, run ZKM_1.jar (failed) run ZKM_2.jar (failed) run ZKM_3.jar (successful) > output.jar
example
run deobfuscation only by double left-click on zkm_1.jar or zkm_2.jar ..........
but you must have input.jar in same folder as zkm_1.jar
